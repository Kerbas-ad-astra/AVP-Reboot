Big thanks to rbray89 for creating the Environmental Visual Enhancements mod that we all love!

	Special thanks to: tygoo7, drswagboss, and MegaUZI for testing and providing me with feedback.
Thank you, everyone, for your support! :)

	COMMON ISSUES

		NO CLOUDS IN GAME:

Use fewer features.
		
Make sure you have installed the latest version of Environmental Visual Enhancements!
http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55905-0-23-5-7-3-EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements-NEW!-VolumetricClouds!
On top of that, install this pack's contents and replace all files. If nothing gets replaced you've either not
installed EVE mod, or you put this pack's files in the wrong place.
If this mod worked for you before installing this pack, go to:
KSP Folder > GameData > BoulderCo > Clouds > Textures
and replace duna1.png with the one that came with EVE. If that doesn't work try replacing the detail.png too.
If that doesn't work still, request help on the Environmental Visual Enhancements forum thread which I linked.

		CLOUD PARTICLES ARE JUST SQUARES:
Use a lower resolution texture, preferably 256 or 512.

		MULTIPLE CLOUD LAYERS / CLOUDS THAT LOOK OUT OF PLACE:
Make sure you don't have rolling sandstorms installed. Feel free to replace my "storm.png" texture though.
Delete any .cfg file except for "cloudLayer.cfg" and "cloudLayers-Astronomer'sVisualPack.cfg" in this directory:
GameData > BoulderCo > Clouds
Other cloud configurations will merge together and that might not look pretty.

		LOW PERFORMANCE WHEN LOOKING AT SKY/DUST:
Switch to 256 or 128 textures.
Only if that isn't enough and you've increased the cloud density, use a lower Cloud Density setting.
Either way you should also consider installing a reduction pack to greatly improve overall performance:

		I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THIS/THAT:
Press Alt + N and feel free to mess around. Also message me on the forums with suggestions.
rbray89 is working on increasing EVE's capabilities, stay tuned for updates.

		I WANT SOMETHING DEEP (SFW) AND INSPIRATIONAL:
